# ðŸ”˜ Push Button LED Project (Using INPUT_PULLUP)

This is a simple beginner-friendly embedded systems project using an Arduino UNO. The goal is to control an LED using a push button and the internal pull-up resistor. When the button is **pressed**, the LED turns **ON**. When released, it turns **OFF**.

## ðŸ§° Components Used

- Arduino UNO
- LED - RED colour
- 1kÎ© resistor
- Push button
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Diagram

![Circuit Diagram](circuit_diagram.png)

> **Note:** The push button is connected between the input pin and **GND**, using the Arduinoâ€™s internal pull-up resistor.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The push button is connected between a digital input pin-10 and **GND**.
- The pin is configured as `INPUT_PULLUP`, which keeps it at HIGH when the button is not pressed.
- When the button is **pressed**, it connects the pin to GND, making the input read **LOW**.
- The Arduino checks for this LOW signal to turn the LED ON.

## ðŸ“¥ How to Upload the Code

1. Open the file `push_button_led.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your PC via USB.
3. Select the correct **Board** and **Port** from the Tools menu.
4. Click **Upload** (right arrow icon).
5. Press the button and see the LED respond.

## âœ… Expected Output

- ðŸ”˜ Press the button â†’ ðŸ’¡ LED turns **ON**  
- ðŸ”„ Release the button â†’ ðŸ’¡ LED turns **OFF**

## ðŸ’¡ Sample Code

```cpp
int led = 4;
int button=10;
int buttonstate=0;
void setup()
{
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(button, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop()
{
buttonstate=digitalRead(button);
  if(buttonstate==LOW){
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);}
  else if(buttonstate==HIGH){
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);}
}
```
## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Debouncing the button
- Blink While Holding
- Using an Interrupt
